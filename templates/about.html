                        <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Kartik â€” the person behind this blog.</p>

                        <p>I started Kartik's Blogs as a simple space to write about things I care about â€” tech, creativity, thoughts, ideas, and sometimes just random observations about life.</p>

                        <b>Who am I?</b>
                       <p>I'm someone who enjoys learning, building, and sharing. Whether it's coding a project, writing about data engineering, or exploring how the internet works, I like understanding the why behind things. I also enjoy sharing that knowledge in ways that are easy to read and (hopefully) fun.</p>
